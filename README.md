# Posturify

## Introduction

Posturify is an app that allows users to maintain a correct posture while they are sitting down and working at their office/home. The phone, placed at an appropriate position, uses the front-facing camera in order to periodically assess the posture of the user by calculating the differences in the coordinates of the shoulders and hips. The app also offers a statistics page and settings to adjust several parameters on how the posture is detected.
